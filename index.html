It is a canal-faring voyage-its' crew and cargo-are agents that link the commons as they relate to local networks and a more global complex of food sovereignty and stewards of the land, air and water.

          <p>In the Belly of the City...is an intervention amidst the already present theater of the canal.</p>
          <p>It brings small-scale, local farmers into contact with the global flow of goods and foreign trade - through its sheer presence, new dialogues emerge and crucial shifts in food transport and the building of regional economies are demonstrated.</p>

      <h1>Season 1: July - October 2024</h1>
      <p>A floating platform moves along the Brussels-Charleroi Canal between Halle and
      Brussels. It is a public artwork, a stage and a functional food transport vessel which
      moves biological food (produced by a network of farmers in the Pajottenland) and
      hosts a consortium of collaborators on board. It is both an artwork and a call to action
      to reconsider our food systems, re-imagine food production and activate pathways
      between farmers and consumers - literally and figuratively a platform for bringing
      this conversation into the public sphere.</p>

      <h1>On-board: Consortium of Collaborators</h1>
      <p>A trans-disciplinary group of artists, writers, farmers, policymakers, designers and
      cyber-feminists aligned through overlapping conceptual transects and critical prac-
      tices related to systems of food production and consumption and questions around
      technical innovation. Each artist performs their work and opens it up to other collabo-
      rators and further to the public through hands-on workshops and public events.</p>

        <p>"This canal-voyage can be called a museum-event, an art movement with no fixed location but instead, in the phrase of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, represents a line of
        flight and an inspired "deterritorialisation”. It is mobile and nomadic, moving from lock
        to lock and city to countryside.”</p>

      <p>It is a traveling platform providing a novel space and opportunity for debate and stimulation in the various stops at which it moors.</p>

      <h1>Ethos: Old tools, new tricks...</h1>
      <p>We demonstrate low-tech, open-source propositions where the maxim is not the domination of nature but the mastery of non-mastery as with the use of sun to move our
      vessel and to transmit and receive messages. The point is not to oppose technology
      and science but to shift control and oversight of the means of production from the few
      to the many.</p>

      <p>We draw upon old technologies, forgotten experiments, technological follies and spin
      them into contemporary use. We turn to the sun as our source of energy and inspiration and play out possibilities for sourcing her power for transport, communication
      and seasonal rituals. A Farm that Sailed Away is an example of retro-innovation: pulling smaller carbon footprint technologies from the past and using them as tools for
      redefining new paths of "development” -drawing people into relation with their food;
      its origins, its growers, its seasonality and possibilities for feeding our imaginations.</p>

      <h1>A PILOT PROGRAM LEADING TOWARDS A PERMANENT FLOATING COMMONS.</h1>
      <p>In the Belly of the City: Season One is a provocation to support a permanent solution for food
      transport between country and city - an opportunity to imagine creative ways to move along
      the canal, engage with docks, other vessels, partners along the canal, gangways and mooring arrangements. The project provides a novel space and opportunity for debate and stimulation and time to test out ideas and tune the route - where we discover together and develop appropriate technology, partnerships and programs that mirror the ethos of the project. A flexible program allows other projects to join and new programs to evolve in an effort to form a permanent, cooperatively run, self-sustaining, floating transport between Halle and Brussels.</p>
      <p>We wish to experiment with this form; how to animate its route and presence with artistic interventions, how to cultivate relations with existing projects and communities along the way, and co-develop new agrarian rituals connected to foodways and contemporary art</p>

      <p>Consortium of Collaborators (i liked the Constellation of Collaborators though?)</p>

      <p>In the Belly of the City... is being developed in dialogue with a panel of consultants
      and developed collectively between local actors.</p>

      <p>Season One launches with a rotating crew of artists, farmers, anthropologists, biologists, bakers, activists and policy makers aligned through overlapping practices related to food sovereignty, co-creation and new agrarian rituals connected to foodways and contemporary art. Each collaborator performs their work with the intention to draw in new actors through hands-on workshops and public events.</p>
